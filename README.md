### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stephan. My pronouns are he/him. 

In my day job, I work on the Salesforce platform, writing Apex code.

I do this using the neovim editor. To help me with that, I'm developing a [neovim plugin for Salesforce developers](https://github.com/stephanspiegel/kraftwerk.nvim).

I live in Portland, Maine, where I like to paddle my canoe :canoe: and forage for berries :blueberries: and mushrooms :mushroom:.
